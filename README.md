# Basic Blackjack Simulation

[TODO]: # (Change README.md Headline to better fit to your project!)

This repository contains a student project created for an ongoing lecture on object-oriented programming with Java at HWR Berlin (summer term 2022).

## Abstract

This project deals with a blackjack simulation. A blackjack instance can be created and players can be added.
These players randomly set their stakes above the minimum stake. If a player does not meet the minimum stake,
he is eliminated from the game. After the players have placed their stakes, the dealer draws his first card
and reveals it. Then all players draw two cards. From then on, the player automatically decides whether or not
to continue drawing, according to the logic of whether or not his hand count is less than or equal to 16. As
soon as all players no longer want to draw, the dealer draws according to the same logic. When the dealer has
finished, the handcounts of the players are compared with those of the dealer. Players who win get their stake
added to their bankroll. Players who have lost get their stake deducted from their bankroll. In this simulation,
an ace can also have the value 1 or 11, depending on what suits the handcount of the player or dealer better.
